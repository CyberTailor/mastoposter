# mastoposter - easy-to-use mastodon-to-[everything] reposter!

Mastoposter is a simple zero-headache* service that forwards your toots from any
Mastodon-compatible Fediverse software (Pleroma also works!) to any of your
other services! For now it supports only Discord webhooks and Telegram, but it
can be easily extended to support pretty much anything!

## Installation

You can run it either on your host machine, or inside a Docker container.
In any case, you have to clone that repo first in order to do anything:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hatkidchan/mastoposter && cd mastoposter
```

After that, you can either run it in Docker, set up a standalone systemd
service, or just run it as it is!

### Docker:

```sh
docker build -t mastoposter .
docker run --restart=always -dv /path/to/config.ini:/config.ini:ro --name mastoposter mastoposter
```

And you should be good to go

### Systemd

Let's say that you've cloned that repo to the `$MASTOPOSTER_ROOT`, then
configuration should look something like that:

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Crossposter from Mastodon
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=$MASTOPOSTER_USER
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 -m mastoposter config.ini
WorkingDirectory=$MASTOPOSTER_ROOT
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=network.target
```

Before running it though, don't forget to install dependencies from the 
./requirements.txt, but it's a good idea to use a virtual environment for that.
Though, that's outside of the scope of that, so I won't cover it here.

### Running manually
Just be in the folder with it, have dependencies installed and run:
python3 -m mastoposter config.ini

## Configuration

WIP, there's a lot to cover
